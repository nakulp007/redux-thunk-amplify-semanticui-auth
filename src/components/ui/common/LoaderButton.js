/*
This is a really simple component that takes an isLoading flag and 
the text that the button displays in the two states 
(the default state and the loading state). 
The disabled prop is a result of what we have currently in our 
Login button. And we ensure that the button is disabled when 
isLoading is true. This makes it so that the user canâ€™t click it 
while we are in the process of logging them in.
